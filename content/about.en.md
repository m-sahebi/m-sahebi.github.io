Previously a game designer and developer on Web, PC and Mobile platforms. Now a JavaScript-lover frontend developer, specialised in React.
I've started coding since I was 14 and beside it, I've been very passionate about teaching and mentoring people and had great successes in long-term and short-term learning paths.
